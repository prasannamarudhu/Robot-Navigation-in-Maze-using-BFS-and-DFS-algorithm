    * @class    Algorithm algorithm.h "src/Algorithm/algorithm.h"
    * @brief    Algorithm class provides base class functionality for any algorithm to interact with mms simulator.
    * @details  Algorithm class is designed to analyze the maze file discovered from the simulator and find a path
    *           As the search algorithm produces a path to the goal area, the robot is commanded to move through the visited
    *           point list towards the goal. Robot movement commands are acheived through the API commands in a separate function. \n
    *           solve(): Checks if an evaluated point has reached the goal location and traces final path produced from required algorithm. \n 
    *           generatePath(): Runs required algorithm to search and evaluate points while producing a suitable path to the goal. \n
    *           followPath(): Performs checks to verify robot can move to next point among accessbile points. \n
    *           moveRobot(): Performs commands to API functions for robot to move through maze. \n
    *           printPath(): Displays path discovered from the algorithm. \n
    *           colorPath(): Sets different color to finalized path in simulation display. \n
