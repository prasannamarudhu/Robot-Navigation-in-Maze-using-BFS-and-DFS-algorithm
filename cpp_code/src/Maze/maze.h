/*! @class Maze maze.h "src/Maze/maze.h"
 * @brief Maze class for maze file interpretation and manipulation.
 * @details Maze class interprets provided maze file for analysis.
 * Maze default size is set to 16x16 cells. Functions in Maze class are designed
 * to manipulate and set maze characteristics in mouse simulator. Outputs are mostly 
 * to simulator API. \n
 * Member functions of this class are as follows: \n
 * isWall(): Checks for wall present in specified direction. Returns false if no wall found \n
 * readWall(): Reads presence of wall in maze file from given position and current robot heading \n
 * setWall(): Sets wall in maze simulator based on discoveries from search algorithm and readWall \n
 * colorCenter(): Colors center of maze to distinguish goal in the simulator environment \n
 * textCenter(): Texts center of maze to mark goal in the simulator environment \n
 * setVisited(): Set a certain cell. Done by algorithm implementation \n
 * isVisited(): Checks if a certain cell is visited in the algorithm implementation \n
 * isGoal(): Checks if the input is one of the possible goal nodes or not \n
 * isCellValid(): Checks if the input location is a valid cell coordinate or not \n
 * getValue(): returns the value stored in a particular cell. Used for debugging \n
 * printMaze(): Prints maze in command window for debugging \n
